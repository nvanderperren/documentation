# Newspaper Content Profile

We have 10 different IEs (i.e. each of the 10 pages) and we can discern between three representations of each of those IEs, thus resulting in 30 representations.
From a content partner's perspective, however, the first scenario seems the most favourable: a user of a dissemination platform will generally first look for a specific newspaper edition before looking at/reading the specific pages belonging to that edition.
If the newspaper were to have been archived as in the second scenario, this granularity/distinction between the edition and its separate pages would not exist, thereby limiting or at least preventing an effective search.
