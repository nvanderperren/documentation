{: .note }
This section and the examples throughout this specification based on it, are to be considered informative.

One of meemoo's content partners, the (fictional) Flemish Cat Museum (henceforth FCM), wishes to archive a number of rare digitised pictures of the Felis Catus Flamens (a cat species originating in Flanders and threatened with extinction).
More specifically, the FCM owns two pictures of the Felis Catus Flamens lying on a sofa and one picture of the Felis Catus Flamens on its cat tree.

The FCM views the Felis Catus Flamens itself as the IE of the SIP.
They furthermore consider the two different environments in which the cat appears, as two separate representations of subIEs (i.e. lying on a sofa and sitting on a cat tree) since they have different metadata about both environments available.
This therefore results in one main IE (i.e. the Felis Catus Flamens), two subIEs (i.e. the cat lying on a sofa and sitting on a cat tree) and two representations, each representing one of the subIEs.
One representation then consists of two pictures, while the other consists of one picture.
